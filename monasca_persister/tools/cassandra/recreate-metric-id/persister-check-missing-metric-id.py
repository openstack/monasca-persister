"""Persister check for missing metric_id tool

   This tool is designed to 'fix' the rare instance when a metric_id
   has been removed from a row in Cassandra. That can cause issues
   when monasca-api retrieves the metric and tries to decode it.

   Configure this tool by copying the Monasca Persister settings from
   /opt/stack/service/monasca/etc/persister-config.yml in to a config
   .ini file (see template).

   Start the tool as stand-alone process by running
   'sudo -u mon_persister <venv python> \
   <venv path>/site-packages/monasca_persister/persister-check-missing-metric-id.py \
   --config-file <config file>'

   When done, you may delete the config .ini file.
